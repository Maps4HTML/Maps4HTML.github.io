# MapML-Leaflet-Client
MapML JavaScript client for Leaflet.js

Will not work currently, as the CORS header is absent from the referenced server at present.  
If you proxy those services, though, it should [work](http://geogratis.gc.ca/mapml/client/map-carte.html) if you get the MapML through your proxy.
